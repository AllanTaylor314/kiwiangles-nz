<p>At Kiwi Angles, we allow you to bring a piece of New Zealand home, or bring back memories of your travels while you were here. We have a selection of photographs from around the country, particularly the Canterbury region. Each photograph has a letter found in iconic spots across our beautiful country. Spell out your name or any words you desire. Try out some words <a routerLink="/playground/">here</a>, or view our full selection of letters in the <a routerLink="/gallery">gallery</a>.</p>
<p>We are a year 13 Commerce team participating in the Young Enterprise Scheme (YES). Our mission for this year is to inspire creativity as you view New Zealand through a new lens.</p>
